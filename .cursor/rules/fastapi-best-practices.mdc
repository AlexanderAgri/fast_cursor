- Document each endpoint with clear descriptions and examples using docstrings.
- Use FastAPI's built-in OpenAPI documentation features to auto-generate API docs.
- Implement proper status codes for each response to enhance clarity.
- Use dependency injection for shared logic and authentication.
- Organize routes logically, grouping related endpoints together.
